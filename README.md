- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Two pump blood to the gills, while one pumps it to the rest of the body.
                And when they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling over swimmingâ€”it's less tiring for them!
